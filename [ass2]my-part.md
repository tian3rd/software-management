# 2.6.1 Our team's adoption of democratic management style for assignments

Our team has been taking advantage of the democratic management style because it creates more flexibility and encourages teamwork and idea-sharing. First of all, we firmly believe every team member's ideas deserve to be heard and valued, and that we can achieve positive results through active collaboration. Our team of five consists of undergraduate and postgraduate students with different skillsets. A diversity of perspectives will indeed facilitate the whole teamwork process much more than making decisions in isolation. This is also one of the main reason we are using the democratic style to work on our weekly worksheet throughout the semester.  
Second, the democratic style drives up the responsibility since everyone feels appreciated by the team. This kind of responsibility, in turn, keeps the team morale high and improves mutual respect among the team. As a result, it helps us contribute to the assignment more robustly.
Third, the democratic style grants us way more flexibility than authoritative and pacesetting styles. As a matter of fact, we meet via Zoom once a week to set the agenda while cooperating with each other throughout the week by using tools including Google Drive and WeChat. The flexible schedules under democratic style drastically improve our team efficiency and we can contribute to our tasks whenever available. Furthermore, by exploiting functionalities like real-time editing, commenting and collaboration which are integrated with these collaboration tools, we manage to avoid one of the major drawbacks of wasting too much time on the endless meetings where consensus is elusive. In conclusion, a democratic management style spurs fresh new ideas while maintaining a high level of flexibility, responsibility and efficiency at the same time.
