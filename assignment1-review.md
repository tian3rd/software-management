## Introduction

The ability to provide quality peer reviews is vital to an engineer’s career. In this assignment, our aim is to review a report about project and professional ethics from our peers. The main arguments and points raised by the authors are centered around the significance of ethics to project management. We will review this report according to several criteria including arguments, structures, paragraphing and expressions, while also presenting our recommendations on specific improvements in the meantime.

## Details

### Overall, holistic evaluation of the report (18%)

This report exhibits intriguing ideas about project and professional ethics. It provides sufficient details in body paragraphs to allow readers to establish a coherent understanding of the topic. The main ideas can be further developed by supplementing more original work and discoveries. Furthermore, it is not clear enough for viewers to identify the key messages in several sections. After reading the executive summary, readers can’t grasp the key message of the report, which can be improved by outlining main findings of the research instead of listing out the methods. Moreover, both the introduction and executive summary lack recommendations and solutions, which means that they are not included in the key message. The key message in the conclusion, however, is redundant and should be removed to avoid confusion. Overall, the report illustrates engaging topics although lacking originality.

### Coherence and completeness of the context (14%)

This report shows an acceptable level of coherence and completeness of the context in and between subtopics.
For example, in the subtopic part about the ethical dilemma, the topic sentence clearly explains the concept of the paragraph. Then the writer uses an appropriate example to show the case in the real world and gives explanations supporting different sides, and proposes solutions for the situation. The writer also uses words such as “However”, “First of all” to link points together, which demonstrates that the report provides a reasonably complete presentation of the topic.
In regards to coherence between subtopics, it seems that there is no linking sentence between proactive method and ethical dilemma, so the connection of the topics here is a little blunt. The writer can add linking sentences to help readers understand the connection.
In terms of referencing, the writer uses lots of reference materials to help increase the persuasiveness of the article's standpoints, most of which are appropriate.

### Relevance and logic of the supporting argument (16%)

The author proposes relevant and focused arguments that are logical most of the time. However, in some cases the author fails to support their argument with appropriate evidence drawn from the referenced resources. For instance, the topic sentence of section 4 is not well-supported by the relevant supporting evidence. Even though it is good for the author to state their position taken in the topic sentence, the following justifications seem vague and weak in addressing the position further. The fact that the author is constantly referencing the same source shows the author's insufficient research and understanding towards the argument they’ve made. If the author could reference multiple relevant sources and provide more closely linked evidence to support his or her argument, the logical flow of the paper would be better.

### Language, expression and structure (17%)

A major strength of the report is the way language and expression has been used effectively to create a decisive and clear argument. The meaning behind each sentence is clear and easy to understand for the reader. The general structure of the report is clear with numbered subheadings making it easy to navigate. Furthermore, the ordering of the paragraphs is logical, for example the reader gets a background into the theory of ethical project management, before diving into the key point of the report. In terms of referencing, all texts used are clearly outlined in section 7 and in-text references are consistently used and well formatted.

## Conclusion

Well organized and firmly demonstrated, the report shows a good understanding of the questions that were set up for the topic, project and professional ethics. However, it is hard for readers to identify the key message of the report itself. The introduction is a bit divergent from the main point when it discusses the lack of realization for many project leaders and management on the importance of ethics to a project, rather than focussing on the explanation of what ethical project management is and why it is important. Throughout the body paragraphs, there is also plenty of evidence to support the answers and arguments to those questions with some relevant examples and even specific numbers. In conclusion, it is suggested to cut off some redundant discussions aside from the key message to strengthen the coherence and completeness of the context and to make the key message more clear to readers.
